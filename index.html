					<h2>Coz all of me, loves all of you!!</h2>
					<p>
						Anugrah, <br /> <br /> After almost 5 years of being together, I still can’t stop smiling every time I hear your name. I still skip a heartbeat when I see you after a long time. You mean more to me than anyone ever has and I feel nothing but gratitude for having you in my life. Nothing gives me more joy than to see you smile, and I want nothing more than to be with you at this very moment. You are the one of the most kind, humble and loving people I have ever met and you continue to inspire me with your most amazing journey. I sometimes want to just pause and appreciate you for everything you are and for all the love that you have brought into my life. On your 25th birthday, I wish you all the happiness and all the progress in your super-secret sadhana. I know that birthdays don’t mean a lot to you, and it’s only fair, because you deserve to be celebrated everyday. :D

								<h3>The Spiral of Growth</h3>
								<p>
									A sincere innocent craving to know <br>
									And to grow <br>
									An opening to the divine light <br>
									Curious and full of questions <br>
									This is how mostly I know him <br>
									<br>
									For certain periods <br>
									He is wrapped in embrace of the vital <br>
									Acting via impulses <br>
									Struggling and fighting <br>
									Growing via the struggles <br>
									Passing through the downward <br>
									Path of the spiral <br>
									<br>
									And than the he spins back upwards <br>
									Asking questions listening intently <br>
									Assimilating and really trying <br>
									To live the inner wisdom <br>
									As it unfolds <br>
									<br>
									Always thirsty for more knowledge <br>
									Always helpful and participative <br>
									Marching blissfully on the path progress <br>
									With shining eyes and ear to ear to smile. <br>
